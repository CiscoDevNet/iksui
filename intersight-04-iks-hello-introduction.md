# Introduction

This lab walks you through the provisioning of an IKS cluster in Intersight using its UI and ClickOps. To automate the same with Intersight Service for Terraform, please refer to the following learning lab and sandbox:

TBD

## Objectives

When you complete this Learning Lab, you will be familiar with:
*	Use Intersight UI to provision IP Pool
*   Use Intersight UI to provision IKS policies
*   Use Intersight UI to provision IKS profiles
*   Use Intersight UI to provision IKS cluster
*   Use Intersight UI to configure IKS add-ons
*   Use Intersight UI to scale up and down the cluster
*   Use Intersight UI to change policies affecting several IKS clusters
*   Use Intersight UI to Undeploy IKS profiles
*   Use Intersight UI to Delete IKS Clusters

## Audience
*	Cloud Admins who would like to provide IT Container As A Service (CAAS) on vSphere Infrastructure  
*	DevOps who would like to deploy and manage k8s clusters

## Caveats

* For a successful tutorial, lab user will follow the instructions in this lab without modifying any other attributes or deleting any resources.

### Kubernetes as a Container Orchestration Platform

Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
On eof the main tenets of Kubernetes is giving you the freedom to take advantage of on-premises, hybrid, or public cloud infrastructure, letting you effortlessly move workloads to where it matters to you.

While DevOps has successfully leveraged public clouds offerings of Kubernetes to host containerized workloads, IKS provides the platform to bring the same cloud experience on prem on your vSphere Infrastructure.

### Intersight Kubernetes Service - IKS

IKS is a SaaS-delivered, turn-key container management platform for multicloud, consistent production-grade Kubernetes. It:

*	runs on ANY infrastructure as a lightweight self-hosted software. Optimized for Cisco HX and UCS, deployed on top of VMware vSphere, with bare metal options coming soon
*	automates the installation, deployment and lifecycle management (OS updates/Kubernetes updates) of 100% upstream self-service K8s clusters via an easy-to-use simple ser interface
*	includes all the necessary networking (CNI, ACI CNI, Istio service mesh), persistent storage (CSI), logging (EKF), monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana), L4/L7 load balancing and registry tooling, RBAC configuration
*	integrates with AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud (coming soon)
*	is built for the enterprise with hardened security and enhanced availability features like multi-master nodes and self-healing
*	optimized for AI/ML workloads with multi-GPU support

## Prerequisites

*   Please verify licensing requirement to use the Intersight Kubernetes Service. You will need the Premier or Advantage license to be able to use IKS:

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/license.png)

*   Please make a reservation at the following IKS with UI & ClickOps Sandbox:

TBD - link to SB?

*   Upon reservation, you will have received another email indicating access to VPN credentials.

![](intersight-03-iks-hello-images/Picture4.png)

*   Follow above instructions to connect to the necessary VPN connection (this is necessary to access the vSphere, IKS cluster and App instance later.)

## Pre-configured elements (Sandbox Topology)

To make for a consistent experience, the following elements are pre-configured in the accompanying sandbox environment.

![](intersight-03-iks-hello-images/Picture33.png)

##### Lab user accounts in Intersight SAAS
Intersight is a SaaS-delivered, common platform for intelligent visualization, optimization, and orchestration for applications and infrastructure across hybrid cloud. Lab user will be provided with a temporary account for the duration of this sandbox. You will need this to execute some manual steps later in the lab.


##### UCS Emulator
Cisco UCS Platform Emulator is the Cisco UCS Manager application bundled into a virtual machine (VM). The VM includes software that emulates hardware communications for the Cisco Unified Computing System (Cisco UCS) hardware that is configured and managed by Cisco UCS Manager.

##### Intersight Assist
Cisco Intersight Assist helps you add endpoint devices to Cisco Intersight. A datacenter could have multiple devices that do not connect directly with Cisco Intersight. Any device that is supported by Cisco Intersight but does not connect directly with it, will need a connection mechanism. Cisco Intersight Assist provides that connection mechanism, and helps you add devices into Cisco Intersight.

##### VMWare vSphere
This is the hypervisor managing the IKS cluster VMâ€™s being created for k8s control plane and worker nodes.


# Login to Intersight

Next login to Intersight with the link provided in your invitation email. 

__Step 1:__: Examine pre-configured elements (Intersight Targets)

The following targets are pre-configured in Intersight corresponding to the remote entities and agents that it integrates with. Please ignore the Terraform related Targets since we will not be using those in this learning lab.

![](intersight-03-iks-hello-images/Picture5.png)



The above targets are required to account for Intersight's integrations with the on prem entities. If any of the above shows as "Not Connected" please do not use the sandbox - you can terminate and start another reservation.

# Use Intersight UI to provision IP Pool

As a Cloud Admin, you will allocate ip pools to the various application teams to provision their IKS clusters. You can either create a single pool that can be used for all of the IKS clusters or provision multiple IP Pools and assign each to individual application teams.

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/ippool.png)

Provision the following with the Sandbox infrastructure parameters and click Create. You can skip the IPv6 tab  for now since the support for this is currently not available.

# Use Intersight UI to provision IKS policies

Next, you will provision IKS policies that will be leveraged by your DevOps teams to provision their IKS cluster. 

The following are the policies that you can configure:

![](intersight-03-iks-hello-images/Picture18.png)

__Step 1:__: Configure Kubernetes Version Policy:

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/kubever2.png)

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/kubever3.png)

__Step 2:__: Configure Network CIDR Policy:

__Step 3:__: Configure Node OS Policy

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/nodeos2.png)

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/nodeos3.png)

__Step 4:__: Configure Virtual Machine Infra Config:

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/infra.png)

__Step 5:__: Cofigure Virtual Machine Instance Type

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/inst.png)

Your DevOps personnel can now provision an IKS cluster based on the above policies.

# Use Intersight UI to provision IKS profile for you IKS cluster

Next, you will provision an IKS Profile. This defines the IKS cluster you want to create

__Step 1__: Configire IKS General Info:

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/gen.png)

__Step 2__: Configure IKS Cluster 

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/cluster.png)

__Step 3__: Configure Control Plane Node Pool 

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/ctrl.png)

__Step 4__: Configure Worker Node Pools

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/worker.png)

__Step 5__: Configure Add-ons

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/add.png)

__Step 5__: Submit Cluster Provisioning Request and view Workflow

![](intersight-04-iks-hello-images/summary.png)

__Step 7__: Login to Intersight and verify that the cluster is configured:

![](intersight-03-iks-hello-images/Picture22.png)



Your App Developers can now deploy their containerized apps on the IKS cluster.


# Use Intersight UI to configure IKS add-ons

# Terminating you sandbox and cleanup

This concludes this learning lab. We hope you got an overview of IST and TFCB and the value add of the integration of two flagship products - Cisco's Intersight and HashiCorp's Terraform Cloud for Business.

Help us terminate the sandbox and prepare it for the next labuser by terminating the sandbox that you just reserved:
